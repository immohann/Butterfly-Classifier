# Butterfly Classification using Transfer Learning
A multi-class classification approach to categorize the type of Butterfly using Transfer Learning from CNN 'inception_V3' model  in Tensorflow.

The aim is to create a classifiacation model predicting the breed of the butterfly belonging to the following classes: 

1.   Black_Swallotail (B)
2.   California_Sister (C)
3.   Milberts_Tortoisedhell(M)
4.   Red_Admiral (R)
5.   Red_Spotted_Purple (S)
6.   The_Blues (T)
